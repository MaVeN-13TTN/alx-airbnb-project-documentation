# Airbnb Clone User Stories

## Overview

This directory contains user stories derived from the use case diagram for the Airbnb Clone project. User stories are a way to describe system functionality from an end-user perspective, focusing on what users want to accomplish rather than technical implementation details.

## What are User Stories?

User stories follow this simple format:

> As a [type of user], I want to [perform some action] so that [achieve some goal/benefit].

This format helps to:
- Identify who the feature is for
- Clarify what they want to accomplish
- Explain why it's important to them

## User Story Categories

The user stories in this directory are organized by user type:

1. **Guest User Stories** - Stories related to users who browse and book properties
2. **Host User Stories** - Stories related to users who list and manage properties
3. **Admin User Stories** - Stories related to system administrators
4. **System Stories** - Stories related to system components like payment processing and notifications

## Core User Stories

We've identified five core user stories that represent the essential functionality of the Airbnb Clone platform:

1. Property listing creation (Host)
2. Property search and filtering (Guest)
3. Booking creation (Guest)
4. Review and rating system (Guest & Host)
5. Secure payment processing (System)

These core stories capture the fundamental value proposition of the platform.

## How to Use These User Stories

These user stories serve as:

1. **Requirements** - They define what the system should do from a user's perspective
2. **Planning Tools** - They help prioritize development efforts
3. **Acceptance Criteria Basis** - They form the foundation for defining when a feature is complete
4. **User-Centered Focus** - They keep development focused on user needs rather than technical implementation

## Relationship to Use Cases

These user stories are derived from the use cases identified in the use case diagram. While use cases focus on interactions between users and the system, user stories focus on the value delivered to users.

## Next Steps

After defining these user stories:

1. **Prioritize** - Determine which stories are most important for the minimum viable product (MVP)
2. **Refine** - Add acceptance criteria to each story
3. **Estimate** - Assess the effort required for each story
4. **Implement** - Develop features based on the stories
5. **Test** - Verify that implementations meet the needs described in the stories
